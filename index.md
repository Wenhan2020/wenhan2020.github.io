I was a Ph.D. student @ the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/admissions?gclid=CjwKCAjwqauVBhBGEiwAXOepkSKueiG3QsLdkJ6xL-t-di_FFhJ9HqhBQPh7FHvI2KLnCFmRwH1H4RoCic8QAvD_BwE). I was with [WiCON Lab](https://wireless.ece.arizona.edu/) in the department of electrical and computer engineering under supervision of [Prof. Marwan Krunz](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/marwan-krunz). My primary research interests include **machine learning for wireless systems**, **spectrum sharing**, and **mobile cloud/edge computing**.
