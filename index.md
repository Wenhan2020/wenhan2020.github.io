I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student @ the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/admissions?gclid=CjwKCAjwqauVBhBGEiwAXOepkSKueiG3QsLdkJ6xL-t-di_FFhJ9HqhBQPh7FHvI2KLnCFmRwH1H4RoCic8QAvD_BwE). I'm working for the [WICON Lab](https://wireless.ece.arizona.edu/) in the department of electrical and computer engineering under supervision of [Prof. Marwan Krunz](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/marwan-krunz). My primary research interests include **adversarial machine learning for wireless networks**, **spectrum sharing** and **mobile cloud/edge computing**.

You can reach me by [wenhanzhang@email.arizona.edu](mailto:wenhanzhang@email.arizona.edu). Please feel free to contact me for any discussion or collaboration. I'm looking for a full-time job.
