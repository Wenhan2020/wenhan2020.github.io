I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student @ the University of Arizona. I'm working for the WICON Lab (https://wireless.ece.arizona.edu/) in the department of electrical and computer engineering. My current project focuses on the interdisciplinary research between wireless networking and the application of machine learning.
